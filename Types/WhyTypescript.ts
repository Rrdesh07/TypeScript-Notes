// why TypeScript?

/*
*   Typescript is a superset of Javascript, meaning that:
*   1. All Javascript code is valid Typescript code.
*   2. All Typescript code is not necessarily valid javascript code.
*
*   But who tf cares? The real question is , why should i use TypeScript instead of javascript ? well,
*   Typescript is fantastic because it:
*
*   1.Catches a ton of bugs and errors at compile time
*   2. Makes your code more readable and maintainable
*   3. Makes it easier to refactor and scale your codebase
*
*   In short it adds static typing to javascript.
*
*   Static vs dynamic typing isn't exactly a settled debate in a programming community, but for me personally
*   I'll take static over dynamic types any day of the week.
*   I like to hover over variables and see their types, and
*   I like to know that my code doesn't have an entire class of potential bugs before I even run it.
